        </div>
        <h3>ingredients</h3>
        <div class="section"></div>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups brewed espresso coffee, cooled </li>
            <li>1 1/4 cups Marsala wine </li>
            <li>4 medium eggs, separated </li>
            <li>1/2 cup white sugar, divided </li>
            <li>14 ounces mascarpone cheese </li>
            <li>40 Savoiardi biscuits (ladyfingers) </li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cocoa powder, or more to taste </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chocolate shavings, or to taste </li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="section">
            <ol>
                <li>Mix cooled coffee and Marsala wine together in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Beat egg yolks with half of the sugar in a bowl until you have a clear cream with no lumps. Stir the mascarpone with a wooden spoon or whisk in a separate bowl until creamy; stir into the egg yolks.</li>
                <li>Beat the egg whites with the remaining sugar in a separate bowl using an electric mixer until they form peaks; fold gently into mascarpone mixture.</li>
                <li>Dip half of the savoiardi biscuits into coffee-Marsala mixture. Arrange dipped biscuits carefully in a glass dish. Cover dipped biscuits with half of the mascarpone mixture. Smooth out mascarpone until evenly distributed; top with half of the cocoa powder. Repeat layering with dipped savoiardi biscuits, mascarpone mixture, and cocoa powder; top with chocolate shavings.</li>
                <li>Refrigerate tiramisu until flavors blend, at least 3 hours.</li>
